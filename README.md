The Port Scanner is a Python script that allows you to scan a range of ports on a specified IP address to determine which ports are open. It uses the `socket` module to establish connections and check for successful connections. The script provides a command-line interface where you can enter the IP address, start port, and end port to initiate the scan.

## Prerequisites
Before running the Port Scanner, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- The socket module, which is a standard library in Python.


## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the scan.py file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the scan.py file is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:
 <pre>python scan.py
</pre>
